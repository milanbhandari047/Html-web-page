                <p>CUBE Series is a modular product range which is designed to satisfy the requirements of electrical
                    installations in modern buildings.

                    The range includes switches, sockets, fan regulators & dimmers, hospitality products, communication
                    sockets, acoustic and optical signaling products, cover plates etc.

                    Modules such as switches, sockets etc. are made to a standard size (module) which are mounted on
                    frames.  The front plates
                    can be changed at any time without disturbing the wiring to adapt to changes in building interiors.

                    Use of engineering grade thermoset materials in CUBE Series products makes the range extremely
                    strong and sturdy with flame proof qualities. The engineering grade thermoset material used in the
                    products has excellent electrical insulation properties and does not catch fire. This ensures that
                    the products are capable of handling higher operating temperatures.
