                <p class="subtitle">
                    modern switches sockets and accessories for
                    residential and commercial buildings
                </p>



                <p>CUBE Series is a modular product range which is designed to satisfy the requirements of electrical
                    installations in modern buildings.

                    The range includes switches, sockets, fan regulators & dimmers, hospitality products, communication
                    sockets, acoustic and optical signaling products, cover plates etc.

                    Modules such as switches, sockets etc. are made to a standard size (module) which are mounted on
                    frames. Front plates are available in a variety of colours, materials and finish. The front plates
                    can be changed at any time without disturbing the wiring to adapt to changes in building interiors.

                    Use of engineering grade thermoset materials in CUBE Series products makes the range extremely
                    strong and sturdy with flame proof qualities. The engineering grade thermoset material used in the
                    products has excellent electrical insulation properties and does not catch fire. This ensures that
                    the products are capable of handling higher operating temperatures.

                    This engineering grade thermoset material is conventionally used in industrial applications where
                    high degree of electrical insulation is required. </p>

                    a classic switch range with screw mounting
                    system that lasts many years


                </p>
                <p>SQUARE Series products is a design which has evolved over a period of time. Functional qualities and
                    the mounting system is proven and the technology tested. Classic looks of this range makes it a
                    timeless design.

                    Unique feature of this Series is the mounting system. All modules are mounted on frames using
                    screws. This makes the assembly very sturdy. The modules which are mounted by screws can withstand
                    tremendous amount of pressure Back housing of sockets rest on the frame and provides a firm support
                    - required in case of excessive push pressure while inserting plugs.

                    SQUARE Series products retain the special features offered by the company in the past, yet have been
                    redesigned for modernity. Use of thermoset material for the core areas makes the switches and
                    sockets highly durable and capable of handling higher currents.

                    Ultra-violet rays stabilized virgin grade polycarbonate material is used in SQUARE Series to impart
                    a highly polished glossy surface. Locators in the modules and frames facilitate accuracy in mounting
                    and uniform gaps between the modules. Spring loaded tubes in sockets ensure a firm contact with plug
                    pins for smooth operation. </p>
